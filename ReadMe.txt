This project aims to present the training of an AI agent in a virtual environment using reinforcement learning and to build a game that facilitates communication between AI and other non-intelligent agents. The research goal is for the AI agent to be able to differentiate between the non-intelligent agents and to finish the game with the maximum reward possible. The game engine used is Unity which contains a package that is able to introduce the reinforcement learning algorithm into the game environment. The game focuses on the task of the AI agent to go through an environment made out of tiles, each tile giving a different reward. The AI agent is able to train effectively, by bringing together the exploration of the environment as well as the information given by the non-intelligent agents through communication. After training the AI agent in three different environments, the conclusions are that it is able to achieve the maximum cumulative reward possible by choosing the best path in the environment as well as differentiating between the non-intelligent agents.
