In the link below there are presented the folders for the best training iteration of the AI agent for each of the three different environments.
Each folder contains the "brain" of the AI agent in the ".onnx" file, which resulted after training and also the hyperparameters used in the ".yaml" file.

The other files presented directly on Canvas may have multiple random strings added to their name, due to a Canvas submission problem. Because of this problem, all the files
have been uploaded to Google Drive.
